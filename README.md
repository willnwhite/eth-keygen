# eth-keygen
Gives you a private key and wallet address derived from a [UUID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) (random string). That's better than trying to come up with your own random string.

```
$ npm install
$ node keygen.js
private key: f848b263af317514c7afdf5589baaf262227dd42d9182619b4588294ef20cd21
wallet address: 0xa457a03531558f4a7f2ac2d94b89c669311e6c34
```

You can see what a UUID looks like (Mac OS X):

```
$ uuidgen
C17ED21D-ADAE-4AEC-A035-946222B6CEEE
```
